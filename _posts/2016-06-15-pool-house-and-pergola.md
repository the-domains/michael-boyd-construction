title: Pool house and Pergola
description: >-
  Michael Boyd Construction has done similar work featured here. This natural
  cedar shingled pool house perfectly matches the newly constructed primary
  residenceâ€™s Style, Lines and choice materials. There's an outdoor kitchen
  featuring beautiful Cedar cabinetry, a refrigerator, bar area, changing areas,
  showers and toilets. A white Cedar Pergola and 4 columns adorn the front of
  the Pool house which faces the pool and is further accented with Field stone
  veneer and a formal Field stone terrace set in a random ashlar pattern.
