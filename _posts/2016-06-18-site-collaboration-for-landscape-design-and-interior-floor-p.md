**Site collaboration for Landscape design and Interior floor plans**

As the builder and project manager, Michael Boyd Construction liaises with engineers, architects and homeowners to assess land plan information, blueprint details for all structures, site components and specific engineering requirements.

For example, we can assist architects and homeowners onsite to illustrate the best orientation of the proposed structure relative to existing topography, sunrise- sunset and the best viewing angles. Also, walking the proposed site to fully understand your vision in regards to integrating proposed structures and changes in topography are critical for planning purposes.

Ensuring community covenants are maintained is equally important as they're designed to protect and enhance the vision set forth for the development. In addition, we understand your role of sustainable design and our part in protecting the environment.
