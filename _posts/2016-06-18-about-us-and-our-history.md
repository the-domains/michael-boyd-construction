About Us & Our History

Michael's team of Artisans, Interior Designers and Architects are makeover experts, transforming ordinary houses into dream homes.

Adding a Rooftop garden adds beauty and value to 'Dead zones' or a room addition can be useful for many things, including adding substantial value to the home.

Michael's work includes private residences from simple to complex installations. His approach is to follow the architect's vision for the project, maintain the primary residences' 'clean lines', give attention to detail, provide the highest caliber of subcontractors (workmanship) and source only the best materials... And balance budgetary concerns and site constraints.

A native Atlantan, Michael's grandfather was a prominent builder in the 'old money' area, known as Buckhead for over 40 years. His uncle Stan of Sparrow Construction and brother Mark of All Phase Home Services, have well- renowned businesses, each one carrying on the tradition of quality service to discriminating clients.

Michael particularly enjoys building Rooftop gardens and adding new additions by partnering with established architects. Since 2001, he's built relationships with artisan masons, top- tier landscapers, the finest trim carpenters, wrought iron specialists, grading experts and well- renowned pool & spa installers. His teams deliver projects on- time with unparalleled workmanship, providing 'the complete package'.
