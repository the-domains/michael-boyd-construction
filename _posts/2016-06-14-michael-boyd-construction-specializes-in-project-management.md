# **Michael Boyd Construction specializes in project management for outdoor projects, home & apartment renovations and new additions.**

Relationships are forged through years of mutual trust, which is born out of detailed 

planning, collaboration, foresight, hard work, dedication and consistency. By 

partnering with elite craftsmen and effectively liaising with homeowners, I've 'paid my 

dues', earning the respect of award- winning architects.

It's truly been an honor to work with such talented people on so many amazing 

projects. Every hard fought battle has paved the way for a solid foundation of growth. 

Years of experience have taught me how to minimize 'Do overs and Change orders', 

helping to ensure subcontractors stay on budget allowing for timely project 

completion. 

While working with top- tier architects, I've also learned the gravity of following their 

vision of preserving and maintaining 'clean lines' by meticulously matching building 

materials allowing for a seamless integration with the primary residence. Whether 

we're renovating a home's facade, pool house or detached garage, we source Aged 

brick, stone, wrought iron and reclaimed beams to 'marry' the old and new structures. 

Bill Baker, a highly acclaimed American Architect once stated, "Hallmarks of great 

design are founded through a uni-lateral 'shared vision' " including mutual 

collaboration between the client, architect and builder.

Renovations, Additions and Rooftop gardens greatly enhance a home's appearance, 

increases it's value and produces an environment that invokes serenity, creativity, 

inspiration and renewal.
