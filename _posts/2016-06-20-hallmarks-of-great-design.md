**Hallmarks of Great Design**

Great site plans always compliment the architectural style of each home revealing a distinctive character. We believe in great design through shared vision.

Our teams of experts respect a designers considerations in maximizing form and function of the home. They're attentive to detail, beyond precisely matching the materials with precision craftsmanship, but they even consider a home's orientation and sometimes changing existing property elevations (cut/ fill of the natural topography for example), masking unwanted views and turning drainage problems into creative solutions.

Hallmarks of great design are founded through a unilateral 'shared vision'. Bill Baker, a highly- acclaimed American architect, sums up shared vision rather nicely stating... "clients will ask themselves, 'which product is going to give me the best value?' Ultimately, their decision is about value and quality that meets their personal preferences". He concludes, "It's not just about passion, it's about proportion, scale and rhythm".

The final product of the Architect's vision, from blueprints & color renderings, a detailed construction schedule and an amazing team of craftsmen, a metamorphosis is gradually revealed.
